            <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>I am Abu Sufian, currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Concepci√≥n, Chile. My research interests include:</p>
      <ul>
  <li><strong>Asymptotic analysis of PDEs and optimal control problems:</strong> I investigate the behavior of solutions to partial differential equations and associated control problems in highly irregular, rough domains. This includes deriving limits and approximations for equations modeling complex physical phenomena, often with singularities or discontinuities.</li>
  <li><strong>Simultaneous homogenization and dimension reduction:</strong> My research explores how to rigorously combine these two techniques to simplify models describing materials or systems with thin layers or fine structures. One application is understanding electromagnetic shielding, such as the Faraday cage effect, where geometry and material composition interact in subtle ways.</li>
  <li><strong>Development of mathematical tools for complex geometries:</strong> I am actively engaged in designing new analytic methods and theoretical frameworks that enable homogenization and multiscale analysis in domains with highly intricate geometrical features, which are often beyond classical periodic settings.</li>
</ul>
