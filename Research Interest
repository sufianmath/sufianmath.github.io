      <h2>My Research Areas</h2>
      <p>My research focuses on the mathematical analysis of complex systems described by partial differential equations, especially in the context of control, geometry, and multiscale phenomena. Key areas include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Asymptotic analysis of PDEs and optimal control problems:</strong> I examine the limiting behavior of solutions to complex differential systems posed in irregular or rapidly oscillating domains. This helps in understanding stability, convergence, and effective behavior in applications ranging from mechanics to fluid dynamics.</li>
        <li><strong>Simultaneous homogenization and dimension reduction:</strong> This dual technique is crucial for studying physical phenomena such as electromagnetic shielding, particularly in thin structures. I work on rigorous models to analyze such problems where fine-scale geometry and material properties interact.</li>
        <li><strong>Homogenization in complex geometric structures:</strong> I develop mathematical frameworks and operator-theoretic tools for homogenizing PDEs in domains that lack classical periodicity, such as branched, curved, or random microstructures. These advances have implications for engineering, material science, and physics.</li>
      </ul>
